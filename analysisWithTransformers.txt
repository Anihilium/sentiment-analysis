@RedBeard0531 the iterator interface comes from LevelDB. I don't know the answer:)	NEGATIVE	0.9988629221916199
The return value is basically only used for corruption checking, as it should always be true (except for special cases involving background indexing where it is ignored entirely). We may be able to just remove the return value for this method.Basically, it is always ok for this function to return true (although index corruption may go unnoticed), but it should only return false when sure that the key doesn't exist since that can indicate an error.

@siying You may also be interested in https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e970e918c5300a13360edb57a88871b02dbe5982Yes, isCommitNeeded() and commitIfNeeded() will be going away soon. Possibly this week.	NEGATIVE	0.9968067407608032
@RedBeard0531here is my understanding. A snapshot is technically correct from any time before the first read/write in a transaction (correct me if I'm wrong). The later the snapshot is declared, the performance of RocksDB is likely to be better, because outstanding snapshots during a RocksDB mem table flushing will force us to keep two copies. Seems to me that it will also better for MongoDB since it is less counter-intuitive for users.	NEGATIVE	0.9791569113731384
@RedBeard0531 thanks. I'll take a look at https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e970e918c5300a13360edb57a88871b02dbe5982	POSITIVE	0.804458737373352
Actually a snapshot is lazily constructed on first use at line 140 below. This is just "refreshing" the snapshot to reflect the WriteBatch we just committed so that _snapshot or _writeBatch will have the latest copy of anything we wrote to.	POSITIVE	0.993975818157196
@RedBeard0531 can you give more context about why people want to do it? I understand that by issuing a touch before issuing the query, the extra query time will be reduced. But the total time that a user needs to spend on waiting is not reduced, right?Again, technically, it is technically possible for us to add a feature to warm to cache for a column family. Just try to understand the exact use case.	NEGATIVE	0.9758664965629578

@RedBeard0531probably I have some misunderstanding about how RecoveryUnit is used. In my understanding, after removing CommitIfNeeded(), one transaction will use one RecoveryUnit, which includes one snapshot and one write batch. commitUnitOfWork() will be called when committing one transaction, and the refreshed _snapshot will be used by the next transaction, if we want to reuse the recovery unit. Am I understand correctly?	NEGATIVE	0.9980887174606323
The word "Transaction" is a bit loaded so lets avoid it for now. Consider a multi update that adds 5 "awesome points" to all users if today is their birthday. In mongo, that whole multi-update will use a single RecoveryUnit instance. However, a new WriteUnitOfWork will be created (on the single RU) and committed for each user that matches the query while we are updating thier object. This is because we only guarantee isolation and atomicity on each document, even when doing a multi-update.	NEGATIVE	0.9894667863845825

Hi @lukebrowning,You should vote for the back port on:https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-14835The **Backport** field has been set to _Requested_ - we periodically review all tickets requested for back port.

@benmccann - yes, those tickets are all assigned to Mathias and with fixVersion = next release candidate. They'll be resolved when the RC ships or fixVersion will be bumped.	NEGATIVE	0.9984665513038635
Cool. Gotcha. Thanks for explaining how the process works	POSITIVE	0.9997987747192383
I figured you would mark tickets as fixed when the commit goes into to address them and then release the next RC when all the tickets assigned to that RC are fixed (or bumped to a later RC). If you don't mark them as fixed when the commit goes in, but rather when the RC is released then how do you decide it's time to release the RC?	NEGATIVE	0.9993699789047241

Hey Mathias! Do we need to apply the same patch to MongoRocks, too? Would it make sense to move the test to generic storage_engine tests?	NEGATIVE	0.9994613528251648
Yes, you'll need to do this in MongoRocks. This would make sense as a generic test, but we don't currently have a way to test oplogs in generic tests, and I don't think that will happen before the 3.2.0 release.	NEGATIVE	0.9959826469421387
