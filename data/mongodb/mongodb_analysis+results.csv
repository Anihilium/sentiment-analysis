@RedBeard0531 can you give more context about why people want to do it? I understand that by issuing a touch before issuing the query, the extra query time will be reduced. But the total time that a user needs to spend on waiting is not reduced, right?Again, technically, it is technically possible for us to add a feature to warm to cache for a column family. Just try to understand the exact use case.

@RedBeard0531probably I have some misunderstanding about how RecoveryUnit is used.

The word "Transaction" is a bit loaded so lets avoid it for now. Consider a multi update that adds 5 "awesome points" to all users if today is their birthday.
