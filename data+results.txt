  Won't this mean you can step down a primary (and assuming a busy website  load) 10 seconds of data may be lost?Assuming a healthy network, no.The other secondaries will replicate fromthe primary until they are up-to-date, then elect a new primary.The 10second rule is to make sure that there isn't a long lag while secondariesare catching up (and there is no primary).If the network is unhealthy, then it is possible that data will be rolledback (not lost).However, this was true before, is part of the design ofreplica sets (seehttp://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica Set Design Concepts), and thiscommit provides a stronger guarantee than before: only 10 seconds of datamay be rolled back.On Sat, Apr 9, 2011 at 11:35 PM, Plasma  reply@reply.github.com wrote:  Won't this mean you can step down a primary (and assuming a busy website  load) 10 seconds of data may be lost?

Ah that makes a lot of sense now.I initially thought that the 10 seconds was a tolerance of how much data you could lose if you wanted to switch primaries (that's what I get from only glancing at the code!).I thought that a stepdown would immediately stop any secondaries from syncing from it (and they could be at most 10 seconds out of date) and then a new primary would be elected within a few seconds (at the cost of maybe losing yet-to-be-synced data from the previous primary).If I am correct in reading your comment then it then sounds like its much smarter than that; and instead the primary steps down, lets the secondaries continue to sync from it to become up to date (so no data is lost, even if the data was not yet synced from the primary), and then a new primary is elected without data loss.The 10 second window is just a way to make sure this 'catch up' process will happen fast (as not much data needs to be synced) as to not delay election of a new primary.Thanks for clearing that up!

assert is not normally used for buffer overflow protection (as it appears to be in this diff) as it's a macro that doesn't generate any code without NDEBUG defined.However, it appears assert is redefined as MONGO_assert which may properly guard this function even when not compiled with debugging? I couldn't quickly find the definition of MONGO_assert...At any rate the standard approach in this case would be to use the strncpy function which only copies up to len bytes.

Sure thing Eliot! I'll try to run some tests this evening with idle loadfor TTL jobs in the background, and I'll use the previous commit as thebaseline.

@RedBeard0531here is my understanding. A snapshot is technically correct from any time before the first read/write in a transaction (correct me if I'm wrong).

But the total time that a user needs to spend on waiting is not reduced, right?Again, technically, it is technically possible for us to add a feature to warm to cache for a column family.

This isn't done inline with the query, it is a separate command. It is an ops-level operation that can be done (eg) after restarting a server for maintnance, or periodically on a secondary to keep it "hot" if all queries are going to the primary.Also this doesn't just preload for a query, it preloads the _entire_ collection and/or index. This allows it to do sequential IO rather than loading each object on demand. Therefore it can be _significantly_ faster than just waiting for the cache to be warmed by a query.

@RedBeard0531probably I have some misunderstanding about how RecoveryUnit is used.

The word "Transaction" is a bit loaded so lets avoid it for now. Consider a multi update that adds 5 "awesome points" to all users if today is their birthday. In mongo, that whole multi-update will use a single RecoveryUnit instance. However, a new WriteUnitOfWork will be created (on the single RU) and committed for each user that matches the query while we are updating thier object. This is because we only guarantee isolation and atomicity on each document, even when doing a multi-update.

_Summary:_If when pulling new code you run into problems using scons,remove the pre-existing "site_scons/site_tools/unittest.pyc" file from yoursource tree.It may cause a "module object has no attribute TestCase"error.One of the pluggable modules in our build's site_scons, "unittest.py",masks the existing "unittest" module.As of yesterday, we are nowimporting the standard unittest module into our builds, which causesproblems when there is a previously compiled module with the same name.This can cause a "module object has no attribute TestCase" error whenrunning scons targets.The solution is to remove the existing site_scons/site_tools/unittest.pycfile - the module has now been renamed to "mongo_unittest".On Fri, Sep 19, 2014 at 1:27 PM, Igor Canadi

Hi Chririla,I think I can probably explain what's going on. The  substr expression is currently only designed to work correctly on ASCII strings, not UTF-8 strings, see docs here: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/substr/#exp._S_substrWhen  substr is passed a string encoded in UTF-8, it interprets the 'start' and 'length' inputs in terms of number of bytes, even though some UTF-8 characters require multiple bytes to represent one character. This can result in an output that is no longer valid UTF-8. See below for an example in the mongo shell:     var x   '\uD834\uDF06'  x    x.length2  x[0]// won't render here, it's an invalid UTF-8 character   The error you saw means that somewhere in your data there is unicode character that is represented by multiple bytes, and your  substr computation created an invalid UTF-8 character. I hope this helps!

Trying to report an error.I was running mongodb v3.4.9 with no issue - but when I updated to v3.4.10, nothing works.

Unfortunately, the problem is that even  VersionNT64  has the same problem and is hardcoded to 603 (see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3202260/versionnt-value-for-windows-10-and-windows-server-2016). The installer,  msiexec , does not have a manifest entry to "see" that it is running on Windows 10.

the fix is in master :).it works :) because the first command that comes into a closed connection will retry and while it's retrying all other commands are buffered up. once the first command is execute it then fires off all the buffered commands.

any chance this could fix an issue with connections and no activity experiencing some weird issues? I have noticed that after 20 minutes of no activity on any of the connections will result in a future request waiting for  60 seconds before a failed to connect error is thrown. After that error is thrown a new connection is automatically created and everything works fine again. mongodb logs don't show an end connection for anywhere between 37 and 170 minutes. If I create a really simple setInterval and make a request every 60 seconds I never experience this problem.

@sbr464 the buffer max entries are now picked up from the passed in  options , rather than from a passed in  Db  instance. This change has simply made all three topology types consistent in this regard.Also, generally you shouldn't be connecting this way.

Hi @NatalieWolfe, the instrumentation (APM) API in 2.x of the driver did not follow our driver specification for command monitoring, so it was replaced with a more robust implementation in 3.x. APM is now accomplished by setting the [monitorCommand](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongo_client.js#L110) option, and then listening to the  commandStarted ,  commandSucceeded , and  commandFailed  on a  MongoClient  instance. Also, the  instrument  API still works as before, with a shim [Instrumentation](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/apm.js#L4) class still provided, however you cannot "uninstrument" as you once could.Also, please open a JIRA for questions in the future. We would like to capture these types of conversations for the benefit of other users.

@simplecommerce would you mind opening a JIRA ticket for this? It's difficult to have comment threads on individual commits. In the ticket, could you please tell us if there is anything special about your application (are you webpacking for instance)? We run integration tests against node carbon on both travis and evergreen, and I just did a test run locally with v8.10.0 specifically and it's running without this issue.	@simplecommerce would you mind opening a JIRA ticket for this?<br> It's difficult to have comment threads on individual commits.<br> In the ticket, could you please tell us if there is anything special about your application (are you webpacking for instance)<br> We run integration tests against node carbon on both travis and evergreen, and I just did a test run locally with v8.10.0 specifically and it's running without this issue.	2	-2	 @simplecommerce[0] would[0] you[0] mind[0] opening[0] a[0] JIRA[0] ticket[0] for[0] this[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] It's[0] difficult[-1] to[0] have[0] comment[0] threads[0] on[0] individual[0] commits[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]] In[0] the[0] ticket[0] could[0] you[0] please[1] tell[0] us[0] if[0] there[0] is[0] anything[0] special[1] about[0] your[0] application[0] are[0] you[0] webpacking[0] for[0] instance[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] We[0] run[0] integration[0] tests[0] against[-1] node[0] carbon[0] on[0] both[0] travis[0] and[0] evergreen[0] and[0] I[0] just[0] did[0] a[0] test[0] run[0] locally[0] with[0] v8[0] .10[0] .0[0] specifically[0] and[0] it's[0] running[0] without[0] this[0] issue[0] [[Sentence=-2,1=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-2 max of sentences]]]

Hello,Good catch on the mismatch number of arguments, I'll see to patching that.Even with the boolean removed my intention of the naming was to hint to the next dev what is going on here. It wasn't clear to me at first that it only merges WC options if there are none present on the existing object, so I went with extra descriptive just in case.Apologies that this overrode that work, but thanks for your contribution on #2744! I'll close that out but please feel welcome to contribute again in the future if the opportunity arrises.
